                     Mitchell is a test pilot for the U.S. Navy. Despite Maverick's abundance of achievements, his persistent insubordination has kept him from being granted the flag rank. The commander of the Pacific Fleet, former Top Gun rival and good friend Admiral Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, often has Maverick's back. Maverick is a test pilot for the hypersonic "Darkstar" scramjet program which is planned to be scrapped due to a favor of funding drones, by Rear Admiral Chester "Hammer" Cain. To fulfill the scramjet program's contract the goal of flying Mach 10 must be achieved. Therefore, Maverick decides to go beyond the day's test speed, which is Mach 9, and try to achieve a speed of Mach 10. This caused the scramjet to be destroyed while flying due to the high speed. However, his career is saved by Iceman by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island. Cain insists on telling Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircrafts is soon to fall.</p>

                <p>Maverick is tasked with training an highly skilled group of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet pilots assembled by Vice Admiral Beau "Cyclone" Simpson and Rear Admiral Solomon "Warlock" Bates. Their urgent mission is to bomb a foreign non-specified foreign country's unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant before it becomes operational. The plant is positioned in a very difficult to reach underground bunker at the end of a canyon. The enrichment plant is heavily defended by the following countermeasures:</p>

                    Maverick reveals to her that he promised Rooster's dying mother that Rooster would not become a pilot. This has caused Maverick to drop Rooster's Naval academy application, which stands in the way of his military career. Rooster resents Maverick for this and blames him for his father's death. However, Rooster does not know of this promise which Maverick made to his mother. Maverick is unsure if he wants to further impede his career, but the alternative is to send him on a very dangerous mission. Maverick goes to Iceman for advice on this matter. Iceman has terminal throat cancer and advises Maverick that "It is time to let go" which gives him the reassurance that as well as the Navy, Rooster needs Maverick.

                <p>After the death of Iceman, Maverick is removed from the training as instructor, by Cyclone, due to a training incident where an F/A-18F is lost. Cyclone makes the mission parameters easier to achieve. This makes the escape significantly more difficult, as they have a tighter time frame to get out of the valley</p>
