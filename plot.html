                    Mitchell is a test pilot for the U.S. Navy. Despite Maverick's abundance of achievements, his persistent insubordination has kept him from being granted the flag rank. The commander of the Pacific Fleet, former Top Gun rival and good friend Admiral Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, often has Maverick's back. Maverick is a test pilot for the hypersonic "Darkstar" scramjet program which is planned to be scrapped due to a favor of funding drones, by Rear Admiral Chester "Hammer" Cain. To fulfill the scramjet program's contract the goal of flying Mach 10 must be achieved. Therefore, Maverick decides to go beyond the day's test speed, which is Mach 9, and try to achieve a speed of Mach 10. This caused the scramjet to be destroyed while flying due to the high speed. However, his career is saved by Iceman by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island. Cain insists on telling Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircrafts is soon to fall.

                    Maverick is tasked with training an highly skilled group of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet pilots assembled by Vice Admiral Beau "Cyclone" Simpson and Rear Admiral Solomon "Warlock" Bates. Their urgent mission is to bomb a foreign non-specified foreign country's unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant before it becomes operational. The plant is positioned in a very difficult to reach underground bunker at the end of a canyon. The enrichment plant is heavily defended by the following countermeasures:

                    Maverick reveals to her that he promised Rooster's dying mother that Rooster would not become a pilot. This has caused Maverick to drop Rooster's Naval academy application, which stands in the way of his military career. Rooster resents Maverick for this and blames him for his father's death. However, Rooster does not know of this promise which Maverick made to his mother. Maverick is unsure if he wants to further impede his career, but the alternative is to send him on a very dangerous mission. Maverick goes to Iceman for advice on this matter. Iceman has terminal throat cancer and advises Maverick that "It is time to let go" which gives him the reassurance that as well as the Navy, Rooster needs Maverick.
                    After the death of Iceman, Maverick is removed from the training as instructor, by Cyclone, due to a training incident where an F/A-18F is lost. Cyclone makes the mission parameters easier to achieve. This makes the escape significantly more difficult, as they have a tighter time frame to get out of the valley. During the announcement of Cyclone, Maverick makes a flight which is not authorized through the course with the more tight parameters, preferred by Maverick. He proves that it can be done, and thus Cyclone reluctantly appoints Maverick as the team leader for the mission.

                    are deployed which destroy the nearby air base, as they are approaching. The teams succesfully destroy the plant, however the SAMs open fire during the escape. When Rooster runs out of countermeasures, Maverick sacrifices his plane to protect him. Since almost everyone believes Maverick is dead, they are all ordered back to the carrier. Rooster however does not follow this order and finds out that Maverick ejected and is now being targeted by an MI-24 attack helicopter. Rooster saves Maverick by destroying the helicopter, but is soon shot down by SAMs forcing him to eject. They rendezvous and steal an F-14 from the almost destroyed enemy military air base. Maverick and Rooster destroy two intercepting Su-57s but run out of ammuntion and coutermeasures as they are attacked by a third. However, Hangman arrives in time to shoot down the third aircraft and they return safely to the carrier.
