        <h1>The plot of TOP GUN: Maverick</h1>
        <div class="plotDiv">
            <p>More than 30 years after graduating from Top Gun, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell is a test pilot for the U.S. Navy. Despite Maverick's abundance of achievements, his persistent insubordination has kept him from being granted the flag rank. The commander of the Pacific Fleet, former Top Gun rival and good friend Admiral Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, often has Maverick's back. Maverick is a test pilot for the hypersonic "Darkstar" scramjet program which is planned to be scrapped due to a favor of funding drones, by Rear Admiral Chester "Hammer" Cain. To fulfill the scramjet program's contract the goal of flying Mach 10 must be achieved. Therefore, Mavrick decides to go beyond the day's test speed, which is Mach 9, and try to achieve a speed of Mach 10. This caused the scramjet to be destroyed while flying due to the high speed. However, his career is saved by Iceman by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island. Cain insists on telling Maverick that the era of crewed fighter aircrafts is soon to fall.</p>
