                With Tom Cruise starring in 'Top Gun: Maverick', it should be no surprise that the cast went through great lengths to make every shot as realistic as possible. Tom Cruise insisted that the aerial shots had to be made with minimal to no CGI and green screens. The cast of the film had to undergo extensive G-force training sessions in order to be fit enough to endure the flight sessions during the recordings. In fact, Tom Cruise personally made a 3-month training course to prepare the new actors for the flights. According to 
                <a class="trivia__ref" href="./cast.html">Miles Teller</a>
                , three out of the six new actors threw up every day while filming in the fighter jets. After all the flight training and preparations beforehand, the actors were flown around by professional pilots for 90 minutes at a time, multiple times per day. In these flight sessions they had to make their own recordings and check their own lightning and make-up.

                     on the piano, so he could play it himself during the bar scene. He actually studied music growing up and still maintains his musical skills to this day. Another thing that made the bar scene better was that most of the extras are real navy pilots. The set was built in Breaker’s Beach, near San Diego’s Bay Navy installations.

                Like the original film, 'Top Gun: Maverick' one again collaborated with the US military and received help from the US Defense Department. They allowed for the the film crew to film scenes on US military bases and on two Nimitz-class aircraft carriers with real

                . The US Navy also helped secure one of the last intact F-14 Tomcats in existence and ship it to a shooting location, where it was restored enough for the crew to tow it around while the cast was sitting in the cockpit.

                    Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division helped design the fictional Darkstar plane, which is why it features official branding and logos on screen. In fact, The Darkstar aircraft appears to be based on an actual concept of their Mach 6 un-crewed airplane, which they referred to as the

                     in the November 4th, 2013 issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology. It was supposed to enter surface in 2030 and appears to have the same overall configuration as the Darkstar plane from the film. It also uses a turbine engine at low speed and a scramjet at higher speeds.

                    The dogfight scene was the final battle that took place in Top Gun: Maverick. its impressive CGI took the editors almost a year to make right, as none of the planes used in this scene actually took off during the tensive fight between the two american pilots and the enemies.
